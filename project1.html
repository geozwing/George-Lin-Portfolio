      In SIAT’s Spatial Thinking course, my team had to build a small mechanical machine called “A Beautiful Machine” and the topic was to make something that is related to animals. Therefore, we came up with a combination of a cat and a boxer, we
      named the project “The Champion”. My contribution to the team was actually quite major, as I was in charge of leadership, quality control. Also, I was responsible for creating the SolidWorks model as shown in Figure 5.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      During our first stage of the project, we had to brainstorm on how we should attempt to design the overall mechanism of the model, and we had to sketch plenty of rough drawings in order to get every part accurate, and that includes the
      isometric
      sketch (Figure 2).

      The next step for us was to start building the model, all according to the sketches that we had done (Figure 2). My teammate helped out on providing the materials, while I did all the measurements and shaped them into parts that can be
      assembled
      into the final model (Figure 4). My first attempt into building it was to construct the mechanical parts first (Figure 3), then we worker on the “skin” of it that covers and protects the mechanism (Figure 4).

      After many iterations and constant diverging and converging sessions later, we finally finished building the entire model. As in the requirements of the project, we had to film a short video introducing the “beautiful machine” (Figure 1).
      After all, the video was extremely gorgeous in my opinion, as I filmed and edited it with all the cinematography skills that I learned from another SIAT course, which is New Media Image. Our instructor Naghmi Shireen was very proud of our
      project
      after we presented it on the last day!
