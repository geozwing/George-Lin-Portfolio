    <p>
    In the course IAT167, I created Maximum Power (Figure 1) for my final individual project as I mentioned. The genres for this game are action and adventure, and it consists of four stages, each with a unique theme to it and different kinds of
    enemies and bosses. The course taught me about the foundation of game making through the software Processing.
    </p>

    In the first step before the actual coding. I had to write a proposal for the game with the concept of it, system design, a storyboard, a draft UML diagram and a timeline of my process for the game as shown in Figure 3 and 5.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
    In the second step, I started to work on the first milestone of the game with no images, but rather simple shapes, movements, and mechanism (Figure 4).
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
    In the third step, I worked on the four other stages, enhanced the mechanism for the bosses in those stages and added images (Figure 5) for the game.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
    In the fourth step, so after I finished coding all the necessary mechanisms and everything (Figure 6), I had to search for bugs and errors to fix the game. One of the problems that I encountered was that some of the errors were extremely
    difficult to find and thinking of a solution for the problem took me quite some time which made this step the longest one of all.

    </div>

    <p>
    In the final step, I had to write a final report for the game about my experience on it and the features of it along with the final advance UML diagram.
    </p>

    <p>
    While creating this project, I learned how to manage my time and stress as this project was extremely time-consuming in which I had to spend the entire day to work on one tab of the codes. In the end, I succeed on it in which I could not before I
    took this course.
