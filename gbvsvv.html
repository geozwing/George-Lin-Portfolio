      During my internship with Downtown Surrey Business Association, I was assigned to create a promotional video for the Gingerbread Village 2020 event. Although my position was as a Web Designer, my supervisor provided me the chance to expand my
      other proficient skills in animating, graphic design, and video editing by leading this project.

      <p data-aos="fade-up">About the event</p>
    </h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      Gingerbread Village is a fun holiday contest for individuals around the Surrey BC community to get creative and build a gingerbread creation of what they want to see in the Gingerbread Village. The purpose of this event is to raise money to
      support the Surrey Christmas Bureau by getting people to vote for their favorite gingerbread creation.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">Storyboarding</p>
    </h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      During the early stage, I visualized each scene of the video through digital sketches and storyboarding (Figure 3), which were created with Photoshop. I used them as references while creating graphical assets and animating them.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">Creating 2D Graphics</p>
    </h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      To recreate the Surrey Central district scenery in 2D graphics, I first used Google Earth to see how the cityscape looks with the 3D buildings. Then, I screenshotted the virtual scenery and utilized the screenshot (Figure 4) as a reference,
      which allowed me to trace the shape of the buildings and the surroundings while illustrating them digitally in Illustrator (Figure 5).
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      The challenge here was that the scenery in Google Earth was outdated since several skyscrapers were being built in the area already. Therefore, I had to gather more recent images of the district from Google and tried to speculate how they would
      look from the same angle as the screenshot and illustrated them as accurately as possible.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      As for the cartoon character, I initially drafted the design through sketches. After several iterations, I came up with this final design and then implemented it in Illustrator to create the digital graphic of the character (Figure 6).
    </p>

    <h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">Animating</p>
    </h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      In this process, I imported all the graphics that I created in Illustrator file format into After Effects (Figure 8 & 9), so that each component and layer of the graphical assets can be manipulated.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      To animate the walking movement of the character, I connected each limb and the head to the torso and set it as the parent object, so that when I move the torso across the canvas, it will also move the other parts of the body. Then, I rotated
      and changed the position of each body part in every few frames to simulate the walking movement. Furthermore, it was challenging to animate the movement naturally, as it wasn’t as coherent to his walking speed and his arms would often awkwardly
      swing too high. Therefore, I asked one of my coworkers to demonstrate how a person would naturally walk in real life, and I used it as a reference for the character’s movement. Which ultimately fixed the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">Video Editing</p>
    </h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      In this final process, I combined all the animated scenes into Premiere Pro to compose the full video of the event (Figure 10). Moreover, I trimmed some of the lengthy scenes so that they are coherent with the background music.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">Takeaways</p>
    </h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      In the end, the promotional video was aired by the Surrey Christmas Bureau on social media and was also posted on the DSBIA website, which attracted plenty of contestants and visitors to the event. At the same time, my supervisor and coworkers
      were very
      impressed with the final product.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      From this project, I gained more experience not only in 2D animating, graphic design, and video editing but also in communicating and coordinating with my supervisor. As she often gave feedback and critique on the project, it helped me
      understand what problems were there in the video and what was not working for the general audience. Then, I took those opinions into consideration and tried to come up with the best solution. Therefore, it improved my critical thinking as well
      through problem-solving.
